**Why this app: -**

Okay, so there might be questions regarding why you should use this app instead of the vast number of other apps available online.BanCOVID

So here we go:

- BanCOVID is fully open-source and transparent.

- BanCOVID is prepared for Bangladeshi especially the students of Rajshahi Cantonment Public School and College in mind.

- BanCOVID does not require you to give any suspicious permission from your phone like other apps.

- BanCOVID is scanned by several anti virus engines and will not harm your device.

**How does it work? -**

- The app has inbuilt functions to fetch data from an external API in JSON format.BanCOVID

- The data is then parsed based on some keywords.

- The parsed and arranged Data is then presented visually for the users.BanCOVID

- The Pie Chart is made using an external library.

**Limitations: -**

- The API we have used here is a foreign one. Unfortunately Bangladesh doesn't have any open source API that is regularly updated. As a result, the results available here might be delayed than daily bulletins of IEDCR.

- Another Big Problem is the availability of the app for installation. Play Store by Google is the most convenient place for installing apps but publishing an app there requires monetization and showing ads which is very much disturbing. As a result, you have to download the app from Github Releases.

**Prospects: -**

- Since this app is fully open source, and written in plain Java, crowd-sourcing can get this app to be one of the most feature rich and optimized COVID-19 tracker apps out there.

- BanCOVID is still in its very early alpha stage and prepared in a very short time for Presenting in Rajshahi Cantonment Public School and College Science Fair. It has multiple options for improvising.

- Concept and codes from this app can be used by other students and teachers for making assisting apps related to our school.
